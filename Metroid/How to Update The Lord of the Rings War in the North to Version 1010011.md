# How to Update The Lord of the Rings: War in the North to Version 1.01.0011
 
The Lord of the Rings: War in the North is a co-op action RPG that immerses you and your friends in a brutal new chapter in the War of the Ring. You can play as one of three heroes: a human ranger, an elven loremaster or a dwarven champion, and fight through the brutal realities of the war on all fronts that were brought to life in the lore[^2^]. However, if you want to enjoy the game with improved stability and performance, you need to update it to the latest version: 1.01.0011.

This patch fixes various bugs and glitches, such as crashes, freezes, corrupted saves, missing textures and sounds, and more. It also adds support for widescreen resolutions, which makes the game look better on modern monitors. However, updating the game is not as straightforward as you might think. You need to follow some specific steps and download some files from different sources. Here is a guide on how to do it:
 
1. Download the US patch here: [Moddb.com](https://www.moddb.com/games/lord-of-the-rings-war-of-the-ring/tutorials/how-to-patch-v1010011-and-widescreen). If you have a different version of the game (English UK, French, etc.), you need to download the corresponding patch from the same link.
2. If you don't have the original Rings.exe file, download it here: [Forums.videogames101.net](https://forums.videogames101.net/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=4) and paste it into your game folder (making a backup is never a bad idea).
3. If you have an English version of the game but not the US release, you need to replace a few files first with these: [Moddb.com](https://www.moddb.com/games/lord-of-the-rings-war-of-the-ring/downloads/lotr-wotr-english-us-files)
4. The game folder needs to be organized correctly. The path should read exactly: "C:\Program Files\Liquid Entertainment\War of the Ring (tm)". If it doesn't, fix it.
5. Now you should be able to run the patch without any problems. I recommend right-clicking it and choosing "Run as Admin".
6. (Optional, but recommended) Get the widescreen-hacked Rings.exe for 1.01.0011 only: [Forums.videogames101.net](https://forums.videogames101.net/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=4) and paste it into your game folder (making a backup is never a bad idea).
7. Enjoy!

Tips and Tricks:
 
Here's a little trick for you who needs to choose your desired resolution every time you start up the game: First, make sure you have applied your desired resolution at least once. And now, every time you start up the game, just simply click Options -> OK. It will set your desired resolution for you. This skips the hassle of choosing a resolution every time you start the game[^1^].
  
Now that you have updated the game to the latest version, you can enjoy the co-op mode with your friends. The game supports up to three players online or on the same PC. You can either join a public game or create a private one and invite your friends. You can also use the in-game voice chat to communicate with your teammates. However, if you want to disable the voice activation microphone, you need to follow this guide: [Steamcommunity.com](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=113483891)
 
The co-op mode is one of the best features of the game, as it allows you to experience the story from different perspectives and combine your skills and abilities to overcome the challenges. Each hero has a unique skill tree and equipment that can be customized and upgraded. You can also share loot and items with your friends. The game adapts the difficulty and enemy spawns according to the number of players, so you can expect a balanced and fun gameplay.
